# My Turn ðŸ“…

[live](https://have-to-work.herokuapp.com/)

A simple app to manage workshift of people.

The beta version will have the following functionality:

-   **Login** as a Team;
-   **Add/remove people** from the team directly in the calendar view;
-   The team composition can have different worker from month to month;
-   Manage workshifts just by clicking on the calendar;
-   An **overview of the scheduled workshifts** per worker in shift (or maybe hours);
-   Ligth and dark **themes**;

## Why My turn?

This is my first own made project to test my competence on react and web dev in general.
I tried to not use external library where possible.
The project will be keeped intentionally as simple as possible, hoping to reach a working version anytime soon.

## Short instructions

You need to be registered, but if you want just try it out you can use

-   team name: demo
-   password: demodemo

Click on the plus icon on the left to add a shift with a name, a color and a duration in hours.
Then click on edit to add new person and manage his shift by clicking on the corresponding cell on the table
