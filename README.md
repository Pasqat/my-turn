# My Turn ðŸ“…

![](./img/Desktop-1.png)

A simple app to manage workshift of people.

The beta version will have the following functionality:

- **Login** as a Team;
- **Add/remove people** from the team directly in the calendar view;
- The team composition can have different worker from month to month;
- Manage workshifts just by clicking on the calendar;
- An **overview of the scheduled workshifts** per worker in shift (or maybe hours);
- Ligth and dark **themes**;

## Why My turn?

This is my first own made project to test my competence on react and web dev in general.
I tried to not use external library where possible.
The project will be keeped intentionally as simple as possible, hoping to reach a working version anytime soon.
